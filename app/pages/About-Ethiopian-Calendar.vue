          Historical Origins and Influences
        </h2>
        <p class="text-body-1 leading-relaxed">
          The Ethiopian calendar, also known as the <strong>Ge'ez calendar</strong>,
          has deep roots in ancient civilizations, particularly the
          <strong>Coptic Egyptian calendar</strong>. Both share a 13-month
          structure—twelve months of 30 days each and a short thirteenth month.
          While influenced by the Alexandrian system, the Ethiopian calendar
          developed its own distinct features, including unique names for months
          and days.

        <p class="text-body-1 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          A cornerstone of its calculations is the
          <strong>Bahre Hasab (ባሕረ ሐሳብ)</strong>, meaning “sea of thought.” This
          traditional system combines <em>astronomy</em> and
          <em>mathematics</em> to determine movable feasts such as Easter,
          following lunar cycles and solar alignments. It remains central to the
          Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
        </p>

        <p class="text-body-1 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The <strong>Book of Enoch</strong>, preserved in its entirety only in
          Ethiopia, also provides calendrical references describing a
          364-day year. Scholars suggest these passages influenced early
          Ethiopian time-reckoning traditions.
